About Me!

I was born in South Korea but raised in Howard County, Maryland. Since middle school I have been training to become a classical flutist and was accepted to UCLA as a flute performance major. I eventually followed a different path and am about to graduate with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science in Spring 2025!
